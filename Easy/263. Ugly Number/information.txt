Problems:
How to find the solution?
First of all, negative number or 1 must be handled first.
Then, if a number has only 2 or 3 or 5 to be the prime factors, how to find out?

For example: 180. 
180 = 2*2*3*3*5. 

* You can find that "ugly number n" in this equation: 
n = (2^a)*(3^b)*(5^c) (a,b,c are integer that bigger or equal than 0)

So the definition of ugly number becomes: After this number has been divided by 2,3,5 for several times, the remaining number should be 1.
